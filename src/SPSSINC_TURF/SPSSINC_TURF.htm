  <h1>Calculate Total Unduplicated Reach and Frequency (TURF)</h1>
  <p>This procedure
  calculates the TURF values for a set of response variables. TURF
  differs from simple frequencies by accounting for overlapping
  responses.</p>
  
  <p>The reach for a combination of variables is the number of cases 
  where at least one variable
  in the combination has a positive response.  The frequency is the
  total number of positive responses to the combination.  The Pct of
  Responses calculation uses all the positive responses to any variable in the
  table as the denominator.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Variables to Analyze</span> Select
  the variables to analyze. All should be coded the same way, at
  least for positive responses.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Maximum Variable Combinations</span>
  Specify the maximum number of combinations for which to calculate
  the TURF. If you specify 3, for example, best values will be
  reported for all individual variables, all combinations of two
  variables, and all combinations of three.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Number of Combinations to
  Display</span> This determines the maximum number of rows in
  each table. The rows are sorted in descending order of reach,
  with ties broken by frequency. However, there could be additional
  ties with the last item in the table.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Minimum Percentage of Positive
  Responses</span> If there are fewer than this percentage of
  positive responses for a variable, it is discarded from the
  analysis. Variables with zero positive responses are always
  discarded.  This filter is not applied to forced variables:
  they are always included.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Positive Response Value(s)</span> By
  default, a value of 1 defines a positive response. Enter one or
  more values to define positive responses differently. For
  example, if response values are on a scale of 1 to 5, you could
  top box these by entering 5 or 4 5. Put a space between
  values.</p>
  
  <p><span class="runinhead">Number of Analyze Variables Always Required</span> 
  The value, n, indicates the the first n variables listed in the Variables to Analyze
  box are required and will thus appear in every combination of variables
  regardless of their effect on the reach.  If
  the value is 0, no variables are forced.  If the value is positive, there cannot
  be any removal cycles.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Times to Remove Top
  Variable and Repeat Run</span> Enter the number of times the best
  single variable should be removed and the analysis repeated for
  the remaining variables. Only the cases where the best single
  variable did not have a positive response are used. The effect is
  cumulative, so two cycles would repeat the analysis a second time
  without the best variable in the first round and the best
  variable in the second round. It would only use cases that were
  negative on both variables for the second round.</p>
  
  <p>If using heats, the remove cycle applies only to the finals
  round</p>
  
  <p><span class="runinhead">Reach and frequency plot</span> Check
  this box to produce a plot showing the best reach and frequency for
  each group size.</p>
  
  <p><span class="runinhead">Show only results for maximum variables combination</span>
  Check this box to show only the table for the maximum combination of variables.
  If unchecked, tables are shown for the best combinations for each size up to and
  including the maximum number of variables.  If using heats, one table is
  shown per heat regardless of this setting.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Size Limit</span> TURF analysis can
  require calculating a surprisingly large number of set unions and
  take considerable time to run. If you specify a limit, the
  analysis will not be carried out if it would exceed this limit.
  The TURF output includes a statement of the number of set unions
  that are required. You can set the limit to 0 to see the problem
  size without running the analysis. The size information appears
  in a Viewer log object.</p>
  
  <p>If heats are used, the size applies to each heat and the final
  round separately.</p>
  
  <h2>Heats</h2>
  <p>As the number of variables and number of combinations grows, the
  computation time increases dramatically.  You can use heats to
  find an approximate but usually accurate solution in dramatically less time.
  </p>
  
  <p><span class="runinhead">Use heats for large problems</span> If this
  box is checked, the procedure will run heats on randomly chosen
  subsets of the variables with all variables included in some 
  heat, and the heat winners will be included
  in a final round.  The heat size and number of winners that
  advance to the finals are controlled by the Heat Size and
  Number of Winners parameters.  Check Automatic to let the
  procedure set these parameters, or check Specify to set on
  or both of these values.</p>
  
  <p>The heat size and number of winners values should not
  include forced variables, since they are automatically included
  in every heat.</p>
  
  <p>For good performance, the number of winners setting should
  be much smaller than the heat size.  It is best to balance
  the size and winners settings so that the final round is
  not substantially larger than the preliminary round sizes.</p>
  
  <p>If the heat size is large enough
  to include all the variables in one heat, the preliminary round
  is skipped.</p>
  
  <p>Since variables are randomly assigned to heats, you can get
  an idea of how the heat-based solutions compare with the exact
  solution by running this procedure multiple times and examining
  the best reach reported for each or by slightly increasing the
  number of winners parameter.</p>

  <h2>Importance Weights</h2> Importance weights, not to be confused
  with case weights, can be assigned to variables in the analysis.
  They are not used in searching for the best reach, but the output
  includes some statistics based on them.

  <p>The output includes the mean and total importance of positive
  responses if weights are used. First, the average of the
  importance weights for the positive responses for a particular
  variable combination is calculated for each case that has at
  least one positive response. The output reports the mean of those
  means. The total importance is also displayed.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Weight Checking</span> These radio
  buttons determine how the weight specification is checked and
  used. If All variables... is selected, the specification must
  list every variable in the analysis if any weights are used. If
  Assume weight... is selected, variables not listed are assumed to
  have a weight of 1.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Weight specifications</span> Enter
  variable names and weights. List each variable name followed by
  the importance weight for that variable. For example,<br>
  <span class=".code">V1 2 V2 1.5</span><br>
  assigns a weight of 2 to variable V1 and 1.5 to V2. The decimal
  symbol must always be a period.</p>

  <h2>Computational Notes</h2>The results of iterating the analysis
  are related to the results shown in the non-iterated tables as
  the maximum group size increases. There can be differences,
  however, in some situations. For example, the best two-variable
  group might exclude the best single variable. The iterated
  analysis cannot pick this up, but the multi-group method will.
  Using remove cycles, however, may make the marginal effect of
  adding variables clearer. It may be helpful when using remove
  cycles to set the maximum group size and number of combinations
  to show to 1.

  <p>The percentage results are based on the cases included, so the
  base will differ with the two approaches. Thresholding can also
  introduce differences as it is affected by the base.</p>

  <p>The base for reach percentages counts all respondents (after
  any filtering in effect), so a missing value can contribute to
  the base. With multiple variables in a group, there is no obvious
  other way to compute the base.</p>

  <p>The computational burden of this calculation grows very
  rapidly with the number of variables and the value of
  <span class="screen">Maximum Variable Combinations</span>. The
  output includes the number of set union calculations
  required.  Using heats is recommended for large problems.</p>

  <p>All data on positive responses is held in memory. Only
  one data pass is required.</p>

  <h2>Additional Features</h2>

  <p>This dialog generates syntax for the SPSSINC TURF extension
  command. To display help for this command, run the following
  syntax:</p>

  <p class="codeblock">SPSSINC TURF /HELP.</p>
  
  <p>In syntax you can specify a log file that records
  progress during execution of the command.  This can be helpful
  for very long running jobs.</p>
  
  <p>Syntax provides additional controls over the tables that are displayed.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <p>This dialog requires the Integration Plug-In for Python and
  the SPSSINC TURF extension command. For IBM® SPSS® Statistics 19
  and higher, the Plug-In and the extension command are installed
  with the Essentials for Python. For more information, see
