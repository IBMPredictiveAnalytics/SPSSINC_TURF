</code></pre>

<p><strong>VARIABLES</strong> lists the variables to analyze.  All the variables must be coded
the same way, at least for the definition of positive response.</p>

<p><strong>FORCE</strong> specifies the variables that must be included in every combination.
The value is a number, n, indicating that the first n variables listed in VARIABLES are required.
The default value is 0 indicating that no specific variables are required.  If FORCE=2 in the example above,
q1 and q2 would always be included regardless of their effect on the reach.  FORCE cannot be combined
with removal cycles.
<p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p><strong>BESTN</strong> specifies the maximum group size, i.e., the maximum number of 
combinations of variables, that will be analyzed, including any forced variables.</p>

<p><strong>MINTABLE</strong> can specify the minimum group size table to display.
Separate tables
will be displayed for each value from MINTABLE to BESTN.  The default value is 1.
If variables are forced, the tables start with the number of forced variables by default.
When running heats, only the last table is shown for each heat regardless
of this setting.</p>

<p><strong>NUMBERTODISPLAY</strong> indicates the maximum number of combinations to report
in each table.</p>

<p><strong>THRESHOLD</strong> can optionally specify a minimum percentage of positive responses
required in order to analyze a variable.  If a variable has fewer than that, 
it is discarded from the analysis except that forced variables are never discarded.
Nonforced variables with no positive responses are always discarded.</p>

<p><strong>CRITERIA</strong> optionally specifies one or more variable values that are considered a
positive response.  By default, values of 1 are considered positive.</p>

<p>Use <strong>REMOVALCYCLES</strong> to iterate the entire analysis by successively removing each
best variable and repeating the analysis.  The top of the group 
size 2 list identifies which variable combines best 
with the top of the size 1 list, but iterating the analysis with removal cycles would show,
for example, a table with the best single variables for cases that did not have a positive 
response to the top of the size 1 list and so on.  The percentages would then be 
calculated on the reduced samples.  By default, no removal cycles are carried out.
REMOVALCYCLES cannot be used if there are forced variables.</p>

<p><strong>REMOVALCYCLES</strong> applies only to the final round if using heats.</p>

<p>If <strong>MAXSETS</strong> is specified, the analysis is not run if the number of set union 
operations required exceeds it.  For heats, the limit applies separately
for each heat.  The purpose of this parameter is just to
prevent very long jobs from running, because TURF calculations can
be very time consuming (but see heats).</p>

<p>if a file specification is given in <strong>LOGFILE</strong>, an operations log will be written to that file.
The contents, which are timestamped in seconds, report various stages in the calculation.
For large problems, the time is dominated by the number of set operations required.
A log entry is made every <strong>LOGFREQ</strong> set union operations, so you can
extrapolate to the approximate completion time.  Entries are flushed to disk
immediately, so you can watch the log as the job progresses.</p>

<p>If using heats, the log file is overwritten for each heat and final, so
it shows only the latest iteration. Intermediate tables appear in the Viewer
at the end of each heat.</p>

<p><strong>LOGFREQ</strong> is the frequency of logging completed set operations.  The default is 500000.</p>

<p><strong>PLOT</strong>=YES or NO determines whether the reach and frequency by group size plot
is displayed.  The plot is never displayed for heats until the final round.</p>

<h2>HEATS</h2>

<p>The HEATS subcommand controls how calculations are done and has a very
large effect on the running time if the number of variables is large.
Without using heats, with a large number of variables, 
TURF can take many hours, even days,
to complete.  Specify <strong>USEHEATS</strong>=YES to improve performance dramatically.  When
using heats, variables are randomly divided into groups, and TURF
is run on each group.  The winning <strong>ADVANCE</strong> number of variables are
recorded for each heat, and a final heat is run using all the winning
variables.  The result is an approximate solution.  In practice, it
is usually very close to the exact solution.  Forced variables are always included in every
heat and are not counted in the ADVANCE value.</p>

<p><strong>HEATSIZE</strong> specifies the number of variables for each heat
not counting any forced variables.
If there would be only one heat, non-heat mode is used.  The default
is usually 10 but may be adjusted by the procedure
depending on the parameters of the problem.</p>

<p><strong>ADVANCE</strong> specifies the number of winners to be retained from each heat for
the final round not counting forced variables.</p>

<p>If HEATSIZE or ADVANCE are omitted, these parameters are
calculated for best performance.</p>

<p>Removal cycles cannot be combined with heats.</p>

<h2>IMPORTANCE</h2>

<p>The optional IMPORTANCE subcommand provides importance weights for variables.
By default, all variables have an importance weight of 1.  The weights are
not used in searching for the solution, but weighted statistics are included
in the output.</p>

<p>The <strong>IWEIGHTS</strong> keyword is a list of variable names and weights.</p>

<p>If <strong>STRICT</strong> is YES, every variable used must be listed with a weight.
If STRICT is NO, a weight of 1 is assumed for any variable not listed.</p>

<h3>Computational Notes</h3>

<p>The computational burden of this calculation increases very rapidly with the
number of variables and the value of BESTN unless heats are used.</p>

<p>All data on positive responses for these calculations must be held in memory.</p>

<p>If the dataset is weighted, only cases with positive weights are counted, and the 
counts are sums of weights with no rounding or truncation.</p>
